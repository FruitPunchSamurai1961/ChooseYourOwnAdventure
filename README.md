# Choose your own Adventure Game
> A Choose Your Own Adventure Game made using Golang and provided   

## Requirements
- [Golang 1.14.4](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Gorilla Mux]("github.com/gorilla/mux")

## Running the Game

Apart from golang itself, all you really need is the Gorilla Mux using `github.com/gorilla/mux`. If you don't already have it,
you can run `go get github.com/gorilla/mux` to install it. After that, you can run `go run * -go` to host the game on the a server.
Finally, go to `http://localhost/adventure/intro` to see the game in action!
